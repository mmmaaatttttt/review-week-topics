# 1. Read the resources for Ruby

## Ruby (Do This First)

* [CodeSchool Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
* [Ruby in 20 Minutes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/4/)
* [Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/) - There is a lot of content here.  You can skim through the exercises or try to accomplish some of them. This resource gives a lot more detail than the first link.
* [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_00.html) - There is also a lot of content here, but it is very well written and one of the best resources for getting started with Ruby.

# 2. [Install Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (if you have not already installed it)

# 3. Answer the following questions

* __Question__: What is the difference between a symbol and a string in Ruby? The two objects are very similar, but a symbol cannot change.  What does that mean?  Why is that good for your program?

* __Question__: Write the equivalent Ruby code: 

```
function sayHello(){ 
 console.log("hello");
}
```

```
[4,1,2].sort(function(a,b){
  return a>b;
})
```

```
var name = "elie";

if (name.length > 5) {
 console.log("your name is clearly not elie....");
} else if(name.length === 4) {
 console.log("your name is elie");
} else {
 console.log("no idea what your name is....");
}
```

```
var times = 5;

for(var i = 0; i < times; i++) {
  console.log("HI!"); 
}
```

```
var person = {
  name: "Elie"
}

console.log(person.name);
```

```
// This is a JavaScript comment - turn me into a Ruby comment!

var firstName = "Tim";
var lastName = "Garcia";

console.log("This person's name is " + firstName + " " + lastName);

// HINT - Try to use string interpolation to solve this! 
```

```
function sayHi(name){
 return name;
}

sayHi(); // what does this return in JavaScript? When you try this in Ruby, what do you get?
```

```
var x;
x === undefined;
```
