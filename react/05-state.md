# State

## Objectives

* Understand what `state` is in React and how to use it
* Use setState to change the state of components
* Combine props, events and state to builder more robust react applications

## Introduction

Up until now, we have used react to display information staticly (there has been no dynamic updating of the DOM). In order to make our app dynamic, we need to introduce a way to re-render the DOM. Our tool to do that is state. - When a component state data changes, the render function will be called again to re-render the change in state. Let's see this in an example using `this.state` 



## How is it different than props?

The key difference between props and state is that state is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.
