# React Todo

## Getting started

You've made it to the end of this unit, congratulations! Your assignment is to build a Todo App in React using everything you have learned so far!

## Requirements

* You should be able to create Todos and mark them as completed
* You should be able to delete Todos
* You should be able to edit todos 

## Bonuses 

- Add a Backend! Save your todos to a database and use AJAX to perform CRUD on them. 
- Separate Your Components into different files. Instead of using multiple script tags, use a tool like [browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to create modules on the front-end!
