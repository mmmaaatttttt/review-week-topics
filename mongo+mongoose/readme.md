## Mongo 

Want a refresher on querying in MongoDB? The [documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/node/) itself provides a nice tutorial with a sizeable sample dataset. Check it out if you're looking for some review on CRUD operations in MongoDB.

As a first step in using MongoDB's sample data, you'll need to _import_ that data into MongoDB. For more information on `mongoimport` and `mongoexport`, check out [this example](http://www.mkyong.com/mongodb/mongodb-import-and-export-example/).

For more on backing up and restoring your databases, you may also want to check out `mongorestore` (see e.g. [this article](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/09/mongodump-mongorestore/)).

And, if you haven't already, be sure to check out the [Little MongoDB Book](http://openmymind.net/mongodb.pdf).

## Mongoose

Hankering for some extra Mongoose practice? Why not learn about Mongoose Plugins? [The Code Barbarian](http://thecodebarbarian.com/2015/03/06/guide-to-mongoose-plugins) has a good introduction on what plugins are and why they're useful. Once you've gone through it, you can search for plugins [here](http://plugins.mongoosejs.com/), or create some of your own!
